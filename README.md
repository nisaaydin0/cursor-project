How It Works

The script identifies files on your desktop and groups them into folders like:

Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif

Screenshots: .png files that are likely screenshots

PDFs: .pdf

Documents: .doc, .docx, .txt

Spreadsheets: .xls, .xlsx

Archives: .zip

Installers: .dmg

If the required folders don't already exist, the script creates them automatically.

Files are then moved into their respective folders.
